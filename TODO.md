TODO:
Do I need trak.tv?
Add the ability to view the trakt.tv page to see where something is playing.
Abb the ability to put in an image URL and have the system download it to its cache.
Maybe add a bookmarklet that can add a show if you go to it on a website.
Add the ability to mark as completely watched, and check for new episodes
MUI has ratings - we could add that feature

Later
* Allow configuring different databases
* Allow not using trakt.tv
* Add more info on how to setup trakt.tv for auth
* Investigate if the adb code can be moved into the browser. 
    * There's no reason a server instance couldn't be shared between multiple unrelated user accounts.
