TODO:
Get image from trakt or other source
Add the ability to add a show. Figure out how to maybe search by service?
* https://www.amcplus.com/search?search=test
* https://www.netflix.com/search?q=test
* https://www.peacocktv.com/watch/search
* https://www.pbs.org/search/?q=antiques
* https://www.amazon.com/s?k=good+omens&i=instant-video
* https://play.max.com/search/result?q=house%20hunters
* https://www.disneyplus.com/search
* https://www.hulu.com/search

So maybe it opens the search in an iframe, and then when you close the iframe it takes the URL.
Provide a way to define a provider and its search URL
Add the ability to add to trakt.tv
Add the ability to view the trakt.tv page to see where something is playing.

Maybe add a bookmarklet that can add a show if you go to it on a website.

Add the ability to mark as completely watched, and check for new episodes
Do a better job of showing that we are using JustWatch
MUI has ratings - we could add that feature

Later
* Allow configuring different databases
* Investigate if the adb code can be moved into the browser. 
    * There's no reason a server instance couldn't be shared between multiple unrelated user accounts.
