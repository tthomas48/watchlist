TODO:
Figure out how to bubble up errors.
Maybe add a bookmarklet that can add a show if you go to it on a website.
Add the ability to mark as completely watched, and check for new episodes
MUI has ratings - we could add that feature

Later
* Allow configuring different databases
* Allow not using trakt.tv
* Add more info on how to setup trakt.tv for auth
* Investigate if the adb code can be moved into the browser. 
    * There's no reason a server instance couldn't be shared between multiple unrelated user accounts.
