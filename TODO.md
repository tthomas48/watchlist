TODO:
Add a field for keeping track of last refresh. Show that in settings.
Add the ability to mark an episode as watched. Add a checkbox for "mark all up to this epsiode as watched".
Add the ability to hide automatically if all the episodes are watched. Do this on refresh.
Can we then figure out per provider how to add episodes?

Maybe add a bookmarklet that can add a show if you go to it on a website.
Add the ability to mark as completely watched, and check for new episodes
MUI has ratings - we could add that feature

Later
* Allow configuring different databases
* Allow not using trakt.tv
* Add more info on how to setup trakt.tv for auth
* Investigate if the adb code can be moved into the browser. 
    * There's no reason a server instance couldn't be shared between multiple unrelated user accounts.
